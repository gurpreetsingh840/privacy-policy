This Privacy Policy describes how Gym Lite ("we," "our," or "the App") collects, uses, and protects your information. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Data Controller

Gym Lite is operated by an independent developer. For privacy-related inquiries, please contact: gurpreetsingh840in@gmail.com

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The following data is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage and is **never transmitted to any server**:

- **Personal Information:** First name, last name, full date of birth, gender
- **Physical Measurements:** Height and weight (stored in metric units)
- **Fitness Preferences:** Fitness goals, training level, preferred body parts, session length, days per week
- **Workout Data:** Your exercise schedule, workout progress, completed sessions, and exercise history
- **App Settings:** Theme preferences, unit preferences (metric/imperial), notification settings

### 2.2 Information Collected with Your Consent (Optional Analytics)

When you consent to analytics and crash reporting, the following **pseudonymous data** may be collected:

- **Usage Analytics (Firebase Analytics):**
  - App usage events (screen views, app opens, feature usage)
  - Workout session metrics (start time, duration, pauses, completion)
  - Exercise events (exercises started, completed, or skipped)
  - Profile edits (only when age, height, or weight are updated)
  - Age (calculated from date of birth), height (in cm), and weight (in kg) sent when starting each exercise during workout sessions
  - Device information (OS type: iOS/Android, app version)

- **Crash Reporting (Firebase Crashlytics):**
  - Crash reports and error diagnostics
  - App version and device information
  - Error logs and stack traces

**Important:** The App does NOT use Firebase Performance Monitoring. Your workout performance data remains entirely local to your device.

## 3. How We Use Information

### 3.1 Local Data

Data stored on your device is used solely to:

- Provide core app functionality (workout scheduling, progress tracking)
- Personalize your fitness experience
- Save your preferences and settings

### 3.2 Analytics Data (When Consented)

Pseudonymous analytics data is used to:

- Improve app stability and performance
- Identify and fix bugs or crashes
- Understand general usage patterns
- Enhance user experience and features

We do **not** use your data for advertising, profiling, or automated decision-making.

## 4. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services

- **We do not sell, rent, or trade your data** to any third parties for any purpose.
- When you consent to analytics, pseudonymous data is processed by **Google Firebase** (Analytics and Crashlytics) in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- Google Firebase may process data in the United States and other countries where Google operates.
- No data is shared with any other third parties.

## 5. Your Consent and Control

### 5.1 Analytics Consent

- During onboarding, you will be asked whether you want to share analytics and crash data.
- Analytics is **optional** – you can choose to decline and still use all app features.
- You can enable or disable analytics at any time in the app's Settings under "Analytics & Crash Reporting."
- When disabled, **both** Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are turned off immediately.

### 5.2 Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access:** Review what data is stored locally by viewing your profile in the app
- **Rectification:** Edit your personal information in the app's Profile section
- **Erasure:** Delete all locally stored data by clearing app data or uninstalling the app
- **Withdraw Consent:** Disable analytics at any time in Settings
- **Data Portability:** Your local data can be exported by contacting us

To exercise any of these rights regarding analytics data, or if you have questions, contact: gurpreetsingh840in@gmail.com

## 6. Data Retention

- **Local Data:** Stored on your device until you delete the app or clear app data
- **Analytics Data:** Retained by Google Firebase according to their data retention policies (typically 2-14 months, depending on the data type)
- **Crashlytics Data:** Retained for 90 days by default

## 7. Data Security

- All locally stored data uses industry-standard secure storage (React Native AsyncStorage with OS-level encryption on supported devices).
- Analytics data transmitted to Firebase uses encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).
- However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8. Children's Privacy

- The App is intended for users aged **12 and older**.
- We do not knowingly collect data from children under 12.
- If you believe a child under 12 has provided information through the app, please contact us immediately, and we will take steps to remove such information.

## 9. International Data Transfers

- If you consent to analytics, your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries where Google Firebase operates.
- These countries may have different data protection laws than your country of residence.
- By consenting to analytics, you acknowledge and agree to such transfers.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

- We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the app.
- Your continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
- The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy indicates when it was last revised.
